# CognitiveIoT Reference Architecture + simple example
This repository contains samples for a fast-track deployment of the Edge part of an IoT system based on NodeRED. It is part of an overall tutorial which can be found [HERE](https://ibm.biz/CognitiveIoT). This repository is used in the fast-track recipes which can be found [HERE](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/tutorials/realtime-anomaly-detection-on-the-iot-edge-using-nodered-and-moving-zscore/). Those are the steps:

* Deploying NodeRED to the cloud
* Starting the test data generator
* Stream data into a NoSQL database
* Analyze it using ApacheSparkSQL
* Update the model on the Edge
* Finally, implement an Edge based Anomaly Detector using moving zscore
